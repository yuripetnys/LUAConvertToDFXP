# LUAConvertToDFXP

This is an Aegisub Lua script to convert files to DFXP.

# Installation

You can copy the convert-to-dfxp.lua file to your Aegisub's autoload folder (generally located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Aegisub\automation\autoload), or you can load it manually by opening the application, going to Automation/Automation..., clicking on Add... and selecting the file.

# Usage

After installed, go to the Automation menu and select the "Convert to DFXP" option.

A menu will show up, asking you to select all "dialogue" styles from the script. The script currently differentiates between dialogue and sign styles, and convert both differently according to industry standards.
